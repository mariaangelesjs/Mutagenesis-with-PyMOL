# Mutagenesis-with-PyMOL
A short script to do high-throughput mutagenesis using the PyMOL API in Python.

Download the example file 'ClassA_v2r_human_Inactive_4BUO_2019-03-14_GPCRDB_B.pdb' and 'AlanineMutagenesis.py' to run the code.
Mutation results are shown here for you to check that you have used the code appropiately (getting the same output).

Note: remember to citate this software if you are using it and the paper that it was based for (soon to be published).
